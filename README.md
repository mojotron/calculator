# Calculator

Goal of this project was to make simple expression calculator without using eval method. Which does not
let user enter invalid math expression(trying to catch most of syntax error).
Enerting input this way was biggest problem from this project.
Input is stored in expression object whisch is in infix notation. Nex step is
transformation form infix to postfix notation with shouting yard algoritham.
Final step is evaluation of postfix notation and displaying results.

This was fun and hard project to make.
